1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-home-dashboard.git
cd smart-home-dashboard/src/web
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Home Assistant details
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with HMR
- `npm run build` - Build production-ready bundle
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run test` - Run test suite with coverage
- `npm run lint` - Lint and auto-fix TypeScript/TSX files
- `npm run format` - Format source files using Prettier
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run docker:build` - Build Docker container
- `npm run docker:up` - Start Docker container

## Architecture

The Smart Home Dashboard follows a component-based architecture using React and TypeScript:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contexts/      # React contexts for state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/         # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins/       # Plugin system implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/      # API and WebSocket services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/        # Global styles and themes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/         # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/         # Utility functions
```

## Development

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with recommended React rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Component-first architecture
- Functional components with hooks

### Plugin Development

Plugins extend dashboard functionality through a standardized API:

```typescript
interface DashboardPlugin {
  id: string;
  version: string;
  initialize: () => Promise<void>;
  cleanup: () => Promise<void>;
}
```

See [Plugin Development Guide](docs/plugins.md) for detailed instructions.

## Production Deployment

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the container:
```bash
npm run docker:build
```

2. Start the container:
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

The dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:80`.

### Manual Deployment

1. Build the production bundle:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Serve the `dist` directory using your preferred web server.

## Performance Optimization

- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Asset optimization with Vite
- Aggressive caching strategy
- WebSocket connection pooling
- SVG optimization for floor plans

## Security Considerations

- Token-based authentication with Home Assistant
- Secure WebSocket (WSS) communication
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Local storage encryption for sensitive data
- Regular security dependency updates

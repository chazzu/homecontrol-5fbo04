## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:

- The GitHub repository
- Issue discussions and pull requests
- Project documentation
- Community communications channels
- Plugin development and contributions
- Code review discussions
- Project events and meetups

Additionally, violations of this Code of Conduct outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement through:

- GitHub Issues (for public concerns)
- Direct message to project maintainers (for private concerns)
- Community moderators

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Response Time

Project maintainers commit to responding to all reports within 48 hours.

### Enforcement Actions

1. **Correction**
   - A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation
   - A request for an immediate apology
